STILL TO DO before committing and pushing all of this:

-   Finish getting delete working
-   Make sure activeCharacter is cleared from localStorage (is it actually used?) if removing the last character or the active char
-   Refresh the character list after making a change
-   Toast after creating, updating, and deleting a character
